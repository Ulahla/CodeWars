// You task is to implement an simple interpreter for the notorious esoteric language HQ9+ 
// that will work for a single character input:

//  If the input is 'H', return 'Hello World!'
//  If the input is 'Q', return the input
//  If the input is '9', return the full lyrics of 99 Bottles of Beer. It should be formatted like this:
//
//      99 bottles of beer on the wall, 99 bottles of beer.
//  Take one down and pass it around, 98 bottles of beer on the wall.
//      98 bottles of beer on the wall, 98 bottles of beer.
//  Take one down and pass it around, 97 bottles of beer on the wall.
//      97 bottles of beer on the wall, 97 bottles of beer.
//  Take one down and pass it around, 96 bottles of beer on the wall.
//      ...
//      ...
//      ...
//      2 bottles of beer on the wall, 2 bottles of beer.
//  Take one down and pass it around, 1 bottle of beer on the wall.
//      1 bottle of beer on the wall, 1 bottle of beer.
//  Take one down and pass it around, no more bottles of beer on the wall.
//  No more bottles of beer on the wall, no more bottles of beer.
//  Go to the store and buy some more, 99 bottles of beer on the wall.
//
//  For everything else, don't return anything (return null in C#, None in Rust).
//
//      (+ has no visible effects so we can safely ignore it.)
