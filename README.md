Here I upload my solutions for the Katas from [CodeWars](https://www.codewars.com/) - the grater the number the easier the Kata is. 

For some of the Katas I wrote down pseudo code first, e.g. some formulas and then the solution was far easier because the formulas just had to be rearranged.
An example:
The task was to find the next element for an array so that a new average is met.
<pre><code>
//  Pseudo Code:
//  avg = sum of all elements in the array / arr.length;
//  newAvg = SumOfAllElements + X / (array.lenth + 1 )
//  newAvg * array.length + 1 = SumOfAllElements + X
//  (newAvg * array.length + 1) - SumOfAllElements = X</code><pre>
